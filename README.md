# BSE_CorporateAnnouncement-Notifier
This is a web-scrapper that looks for stock result announcements on BSE and sends a notification, which when clicked opens the results. This may be used as a quick way to be notified about the release and based on the results, take action on the stock(rather than wait for ET to release an article about it(which I imagine takes time))
